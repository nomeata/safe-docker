safe-docker
===========

This script runs a given command in a docker image,
and tries to enforce the following security measures:

 * The container is fresh, and removed after execution
 * The command is run as the user and group invoking sudo; it fails to
   run if it not invoked via sudo or by root.
 * Only the current directory is writable
 * Only the additional paths given on the command line are readable (`--dir`)
 * Changes to the current directory are preserved
 * Upon SIGTERM (or any other signal), the container is killed

The docker image name is hardcoded in the script (`safe-docker`). If it were a
command line flag, the userwho can run this script could start a malicious image
downloaded from the internet.

The option `--timeout` specifies a timeout in seconds, after which the container is
killed, and the special return value of 23 is returned.

The option `--memory` does the same for memory usage. On Debian machines, this
requires the kernel parameters `cgroup_enable=memory swapaccount=1`. Returns 24
when OOM occurs.

The option `--ulimit` sets ulimits for the container and expects a key-value pair
separated by an equal sign (`=`). This option can be specified multiple times.

Not much is expected from the docker image. But some programs do not like it
when the current user id has no name (e.g. those using `whoami`). If you need
to run these, you need to add the user to your imageâ€™s `/etc/passwd`, and
ensure that it has the same uid as the calling user.


Environment variables are not passed through (which would also depend on `sudo`
doing that), but you can prefix the command with `env VAR=value cmd`.

This script should be copied to, say, `/usr/local/bin` and made read-only for the
user running it. Then the targetting user must get sudo permissions to run it,
e.g. by adding the following lines via `visudo`:

    # Praktomat may use safe-docker
    praktomat ALL= NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/safe-docker

It requires some perl libraries to be installed. On Debian and Ubuntu, run

    apt-get install libipc-run-perl libdata-guid-perl
